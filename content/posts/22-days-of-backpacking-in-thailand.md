#Preparations
I read countless articles about Thailand before I left. I wanted to be ready, to know all the places to visit, what to do and what not to do. I learned about local customs and culture so I would not disrespect the Thais or their religion. But all the reading of the world cannot prepare you, you will be ready when you come back from this trip, maybe not ...

Since I was going backpacking and traveling a lot of kilometres, I got vaccinated and took a lot of medicine, bandages and compresses. I hardly used anything and they took a lot of room in my 35L backpack. It is not necessary to leave with many medicine because everything can be found on place and for cheaper. But if you go on a trip in the jungle for a few days, it is always a good idea to have a small first aid kit with you!

For trips of less than one month, if you arrive by plane, it is not necessary to apply for a visa.


# The arrival in Bangkok
Get ready to get ripped off! There is a lot of tourist scam in Bangkok, especially in the street where I slept, Khao San Road, the backpackerâ€™s street.

When I arrived in this street, I felt overwhelmed by everything that was happening around me. A lot of unknown smells floated in the air. I was grabbed in all the senses. But, with my tourist face and my orange backpack, I was an easy prey. At first it was difficult to completely ignore these street scams. Khao San Road is a very busy street. There is food, everything you need to party and new friends to meet. I stayed here for three nights at a hostel for just under CHF 10 a night.

# Getting around Bangkok

You can ride in a Tuk-Tuk and be impressed by the crazy driving. You will then make a trip in the exhaust of the intense traffic of Bangkok. You will rush through the streets of the city, hair in the wind. It is a fairly expensive way of transportation and it is essential to negotiate to go down to about a third or a quarter of the initial price. And yet, I think I was paying too much each time.

Or you can ride a taxi that activates the meter and travel for almost nothing. However, you will have to support the air conditioning. Drivers love to light it up.

# A scam that becomes a good opportunity

If a Tuk-Tuk driver bumps into you to offer you huge "Just for you" discounts for a race or for the whole day, he'll 
take you to a shop where he earns a commission, if you go in.

However, a driver came to us (I was with a friend) and explained that for only 30 Bahts (about 1 CHF) he would take 
us where we wanted and for the whole day. In exchange, we just had to agree to enter the store where he will get his 
commission. We found him very honest to warn us even before we got into the Tuk-Tuk and we accepted his offer. In the 
end, we spent about seven hours with him. He took us to many places and was waiting for us every time. We even ate 
together. At the end of the day, he kept his word and asked us for 30 Baht. We obviously gave him more. Everyone wins!
I even could drive his Tuk-Tuk, only two meters... But I still drove a Tuk-Tuk in Bangkok!

# My visits in Bangkok

## The king's palace

I just walked into the main square but not into the palace itself. The place was full of tourists and the entrance 
was quite expensive. To get into this kind of place and most temples, I had to cover my legs and wear a t-shirt that 
covers the shoulders. So I did like every tourist, I bought harem pants with elephant motifs. So classy!

## Wat Pho - The reclining Buddha

Not far from the king's palace is Wat Pho. You will find a 46 meters long reclining Buddha.

## Wat Arun

It was by far my favorite temple! The place was sublime and calm. From the temple of the Buddha, take a boat 
(almost free) to cross the river and reach the temple.

## Wat Saket - The Golden Mount Temple

Perched in the heights, this temple offers beautiful views of all of Bangkok. After a climb of 344 steps
(I did not count, it was written) under trees and the sound of bells, you will arrive at the top to discover a
panoramic view of Bangkok.

## Ayutthaya

Ayutthaya is a very pretty little town at about 2 hours by train from Bangkok. Many trains leave Bangkok for Ayutthaya,
they are cheap and there is no need to book. Just go to the station and wait a little while for a train to arrive.

I spent two days in Ayutthaya and I had time to discover the majority of what there was to see. The first day, I did 
not visit anything. I went to my Airbnb booking. I slept completely outside the city, in a cabin by the river. 
It was really beautiful. Being outside the city, people only spoke a few words in English. With a few gestures and a 
little English, I found myself in a kind of open house on the road and they cooked me something tasty. I still do not
know the name of the dish, but it was delicious!

The next day, I took a 6 hours tour in Tuk-Tuk to discover sublime ruins of ancient temples. In the evening, I took a
night train (12 hours) to Chiang Mai. This time, I really recommend booking your tickets in advance. I was traveling 
alone and it was very easy to sneak around. In group, it's a bit more complicated.

## Chiang Mai

Chiang Mai was and still is my favorite place in Thailand. I arrived there around 10am after a long train ride. 
I had nothing booked but friends had advised / obliged me to go to sleep in the hostel where they had been a few months
ago! I stayed there for about CHF 5 a night. The chef was very kind and could help me for everything. He booked excursions
for me, offered me laundry etc. His [establishment](https://www.facebook.com/A-Good-Place-Hostel-Chiangmai-1226471354046084/)
was very clean and quiet. I highly recommend it!

## Cooking lessons

If you are a food lover like me, take a cooking class. We visited a local market, then we rush into a lush forest to
discover a great kitchen in the middle of nature. The cook, who liked to make fun of my name (thank you Justin Bieber)
showed us a garden filled with typical fruits and vegetables and explained how to cook them.

I learned to make the famous Pad Thai, chicken coconut soup and red curry paste. Everything was delicious!

## Day in an elephant sanctuary

An experience I will never forget ... By conviction, I refused to ride on the backs of elephants, especially when we 
know what they do to them to obey. If you have never heard of this, I encourage you to learn a little about it.

If elephants are in sanctuaries, they have been mistreated and broken. It would be dangerous to approach an elephant 
in the wild. I hope that they have been rescued and that they are not there just to live their "second life" as a 
tourist attraction because they are too old or weak to carry tourists. A baby elephant was among them; I hope he will 
not suffer the same fate. The adults had scarred backs, marks of pain.

At first I did not even dare to approach these giants, I had a huge respect for them. Knowing they could send me flying
without breaking a sweat scared me a bit. In the end, all they wanted was to walk, eat, eat and still eat. After a while
I was less afraid and could approach them.

We walked, took a bath of mud and finally we bathed in the river with them.

## Trek in the jungle

What a day! After 5 hours of walking in the jungle, I did not want to stop walking. I could have continued walking
another week in such landscapes. Dogs from the starting village followed us all the way. Like Tarzan, we swung on a
liana. We took a bath under a waterfall, rode natural water slides, explored a cave of bats, cleared out the passage
with a machete, while avoiding spiders.

## Doi Suthep - Temple Tour

In Doi Suthep are the dragon stairs that give access to Wat Phrathat, a very pretty temple. It is located on a mountain 
which offers an unobstructed view of Chiang Mai. After touring the temple, I continued to walk the road, there are very
nice views to discover! But do not stop there. Up above, you will find a small bucolic village, Doi Pui Mong. Buses go
there from Chiang Mai but I discovered that hitchhiking worked very well. It's more fun and free! People even stopped
to apologize because they were already full. I have never waited more than 5 minutes.

## Phuket and Koh Phi Phi

When arrived in Phuket, I hesitated to fly back to Chiang Mai. It was much more expensive due to the number of tourists
and I found the atmosphere much less cheerful. In the end it was a "banal" vacation spot with beaches, places to party, 
a few places to visit here and there. I have never been a fan of being permanently stuck to other tourists.

But I had the chance to meet two friends with whom I spent a lot of time talking, laughing, playing volleyball on the
beach, eating and drinking. I decided to stay with them.

I still took a day out for a boat trip to Koh Phi Phi but I ended up with hundreds of tourists for an express expedition
without having the time to enjoy the beautiful scenery. Because yes, it was beautiful, but I did not have the opportunity
to enjoy it. My stay in Koh Phi Phi was more than quick: 40 minutes to eat, 20 minutes to walk and then the guide
gathered like sheep with a whistle.

## The final word

I took the plane back to Bangkok and spent the last two days in the same place where the adventure started, Khao San
Road. The circle is complete.

I found that Thailand is a very easy country to go backpacking. Public transportations are ubiquitous, people are
willing to help and it's relatively cheap. On the other hand, I was surprised, or disgusted by the sex tourism of which
are "victims" the tourist zones of Thailand. It is not uncommon to see young girls in the arms of old tourists.

I liked the path I followed. Next time, I will spend more time exploring the north. I will try to find less touristic places on the islands!

I hope you enjoyed reading this article and that it will make you want to visit this beautiful country. Feel free to
