We cannot say yes to everything, we cannot always be nice to everyone. Saying no will not make you a bad person.

There is nothing worse than doing something you do not want to do. Of course we cannot always avoid this kind of 
situation. We may have a hard task to do at work, revise a subject that does not interest us. In cases where we can
say no, do not feel bad to say no, if that's really what you want

Something happened to me during my trip to Thailand, a story that would not have happened if I had directly asserted
myself and said no.

I was in Ayutthaya in Thailand, waiting for my train to Chiang Mai. A Thai woman approached me and asked me if she
could sit next to me. Until then, nothing abnormal. Then she was trying to cry (it was a comedy). She told me that
she had been stolen and that she had no money to go home. Instead of refusing, I gave her 2.-. I was hoping she would
leave me alone after that. But the problems started at that moment ... She started to perfume herself, change clothes in
front of me and all the rest of the station, tell me that she wanted me to go to her house, etc. When I asked her to go 
away, she told me that the mafia was watching her and that I had to protect her (I was starting to wonder how I was going
to get out of this situation). She finally went to sit somewhere else when I raised my voice. But, 20 seconds later, a 
man ran towards her, screaming. She did the same, but in my direction and this time shouting "Mafia, Mafia".

So I had a Thai screaming at me and a girl crying while hiding behind my back. I was completely lost. After a while,
the man stopped and, understanding that I did not know this woman, smiled at me and showed me his police badge. In the
end, everything worked out. She left and I did not have any problem with the “mafia”.

This event would never have happened if I had dared to say no.

To dare to say no to something you do not want to do, is to give yourself the opportunity to say yes to something more important.
