Patience is a virtue that is becoming more and more difficult to master in today's society. We tend to quickly lose
control when stuck in traffic jams, in an endless queue, or even worse, facing a slow internet connection...

We live in an environment where everything goes fast; our ways of transportation, our internet connection or the way 
we eat. We are used to speed and having everything we want quickly. We have the world at our fingertips, or a click.
We are connected to everything we want, thanks to our smartphone. No need to go out and rent a movie, Netflix brings
the store to your home. The same example works for books or music.

Social networks do not help things. We no longer need to make an effort to show a picture to our friends and see their
reaction. Just publish it online and get the likes. Easy.

All these things make us addicted to something called immediate satisfaction. We do not want to wait for anything.
If we have to wait or work to get it, most of us give up the idea.

This immediate satisfaction can make you fail in so many areas. Who has never given up a hard work because he did not
succeed at the first time? The lack of patience causes most of the undertaken projects to fail.

Patience is essential when learning a new skill (programming, language, music). All cannot be served on a silver platter.
You will fail a lot before you can master this new skill and you have to realize that it's normal to fail. This is the
best way to learn.

In this world, where everything is arranged to save time, do not be afraid to take that time and persevere in learning
or in a project. Immediate satisfaction is addictive. Long-term satisfaction is much more fulfilling.
