We give up all the time. You give up on your good habit to go to the gym or to do sport on a daily basis. You give up
your good habit to practice a skill every single day.

You’re giving up because you live in a world of instant gratification. You can’t really see or feel the gratification
by doing something small every day. It’s easier to feel gratification by unlocking your phone, chat and get some likes.

Why “don’t give up” is the best advice you can give to someone? Simply because you’ll help that someone to achieve what 
he wanted to do. Don’t give up on your project, your daily gym session, playing an instrument. These persons will 
realise that you can’t get anything strong and real without hard work and countless hours of training.

But there is a catch… Sometimes “don’t give up“ is the worst advice to give.

First of all, giving up is often synonymous with weakness or failure. It could be the case, but it could also prove that
you’re strong enough to realise that the situation you’re in is causing more harm than good.

You have to be strong to forget that girl you’ve been chasing for ages while she never cares about you. Giving up is the
right choice.

I quit high school after weeks of indecision. I was afraid to let my parents down. I was afraid of failure. I was told 
that it would be a shame to give up, even if I hated it.

After a while, I finally quit high school to start something I really like. I started an apprenticeship in computer
science. It was a very good decision, even if I gave up on something. In fact, giving up made me happier and I finally 
had a good idea of what I want to do in my life.

So before saying “don’t ever give up”, take some time and try to understand the situation in which the person is. Your
advice could be different.

Persevere long enough to know when it’s time to give up.
