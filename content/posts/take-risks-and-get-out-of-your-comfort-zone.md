Your life is made by a succession of choices. Some may be risky, make you feel bad or even afraid. On the other hand, some choices are easy just because they won’t make you go out of your comfort zone. That’s true, why should you take a road full of dangers, rocks and unsuspected turns? Everybody is different and some may find more joy in easy choices.

Personally, I think living life seeking discomfort can be so fulfilling. The goal in life is to be on your own deathbed, having the least amount of regret.

Don’t mix risk with stupidity. Quitting your job to travel is a risk. Driving at 200km/h on a highway is stupid and you can endanger other people’s life’s.

During your journey, you’ll have to listen to your guts, but don’t let fear blind you. Fear will prevent you to meet amazing people and live unforgettable experiences.

Will Smith did a great [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFIB05LGtMs&ab_channel=WillSmith) about fear 


Every day, you take risks, but you’re already used to them. You’re driving the car or stepping outside your house. 
So why not add a few things to this list that will make you grow and discover new things?

Risks can make you win big. I actually have two jobs and for one of them, I’m not paid at all and I even lose money 
with it. But it’s by choice. My partners asked me how much would I like to be paid for my work and to that question, 
I responded: nothing, but I’d like to have a percentage of the revenue of the application, because I believe in it. 
After thinking, they offered me 30% of the revenue, it’s huge! I might never get a single cent for this application, 
but if it’s working, It’s going to be so worth it.

Failing could be scary, but it’s one of the best ways to grow. If you don’t risk failing, then you can’t succeed. 
Success requires risking failure.

No one can join you on a big adventure? Still go alone, you won’t regret a single moment. I went backpacking alone in
Thailand, one of the best choices I ever made.

Afraid to go speak to strangers? You’ll probably lose a friend, or even more. I met one of the best person on earth 
last time I went to speak to a stranger. She was alone at the bar and I asked her if she would like to join my group 
of friends. Then, we spent few months exploring Dublin, traveling around and laughing all the time.

Sometime you have to say “fuck it” and go for it. You might and will fail. But you could also win big.

Ask you this question: Are you living a life you would relieve? If not, what are you going to do about it? (credits to YesTheory)
